Creates a random collection of buildings, but using much simpler code than my first attempt (towers.py). Also faster and more fun to watch building.

## Towers

Creates a random collection of buildings, code is a bit hard to read. Uses a matrix of values to define the corners of each face of a story. Then towers are made of multiple stories.
