# Minecraft on the Raspberry Pi

my explorations of the python interface to minecraft on the raspberry pi

# Demos

## Spiral Towers

Creates a random collection of buildings, but using much simpler code than my first attempt (towers.py). Also faster and more fun to watch building.

## Towers

Creates a random collection of buildings, code is a bit hard to read. Uses a matrix of values to define the corners of each face of a story. Then towers are made of multiple stories.

# Required

Some demos require Martin O'Hanlon's library for drawing shapes: http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2013/11/coding-shapes-in-minecraft.html

# Thanks

* raspberry pi crew
* @martinohanlon for inspiration
* minecraft crew for making a special version available for the pi!
