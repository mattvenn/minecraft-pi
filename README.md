# Minecraft on the Raspberry Pi

my explorations of the python interface to minecraft on the Raspberry Pi, Linux and Mac OSX

# Demos

Check the sub directories for separate readmes on each demo.

# Notes / Links

Some demos require Martin O'Hanlon's library for drawing shapes: http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2013/11/coding-shapes-in-minecraft.html

If you want to run on another platform, see [Martin O'Hanlon's post about CanaryMod](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2014/10/minecraft-raspberryjuice-and-canarymod.html). My notes on installing on [OSX are here](OSX_notes.md), which is pretty much identical to Linux (not Pi).

My notes on useful [CanaryMod commands are here](CanaryMod.md)
